            <strong>Early Life and Education</strong><br></br>
            I was born in 1904 in New York City. My fascination with science began at a young age, 
            influenced by a vibrant, intellectual environment at home. I pursued physics with a passion 
            that eventually took me to Harvard and then to Cambridge and GÃ¶ttingen for further studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            My work in theoretical physics garnered attention, and I found myself immersed in the 
            burgeoning field of quantum mechanics. <a href='https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/'>Nobel Prize</a> 
            laureates were among my peers and mentors. This period was a formative time in my life, 
            shaping my scientific pursuits.
        </p>
        <h2>The Manhattan Project</h2>
        <p>
            The year 1942 marked a turning point when I was appointed as the scientific director of the 
            <em>Manhattan Project</em>. The goal was daunting: to develop an atomic bomb during the 
            height of World War II. Our work was centered in a secret laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
        </p>
        <p>
            The moral and ethical implications of our work weighed heavily on my conscience. 
            The success of the project, while a remarkable scientific feat, presented the world with 
            a formidable and sobering power. In 1945, the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima 
            and Nagasaki, bringing an end to the war but at an immense human cost.
        </p>
        <h2>Later Years and Reflections</h2>
        <p>
            In the post-war years, I found myself at a crossroads, advocating for international control 
            of atomic energy and striving to promote peaceful uses of nuclear technology. 
            My political affiliations and stance on nuclear disarmament, however, led to a 
            controversial and public <a href='https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/oppenheimer-security-hearing'>security hearing</a> 
            in 1954, dramatically altering the course of my career.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I reflect on my journey, I am struck by the profound ways in which the pursuit of knowledge 
            can intersect with the complexities of ethics, politics, and human destiny. 
            The words from the <a href='https://www.bhagavadgita.org.in/'>Bhagavad Gita</a> 
            resonate deeply with me: 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' 
            These words, uttered at the Trinity test site, encapsulate the paradox of scientific 
            advancement and its potential consequences.
